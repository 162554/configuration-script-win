# My Windows Configuration script

These scripts are for my personal usage to configure a ready-to-use Windows environment for me.

## Re-install Windows

The following command will re-install Windows 10\11\insider for you.

Right click the start button, click `Windows PowerShell(Admin)`.

```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/Anduin2017/configuration-script-win/raw/main/Reimage.ps1'))
```

It will ask you the downloaded Windows ISO file. You can download it with any tool you like, and provide it the file name.

It will ask you for a clean disk drive. For example: Disk `E:\`. Provide it with any disk you like. (Except current OS drive)


In China? There is a proxy for China network which bypass the firewall.

```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://githubcontent.aiurs.co/Anduin2017/configuration-script-win/main/Reimage.ps1'))
```

## How can I use this project?

You need to **fork** this repo, and modify some configuration path in the source code.

For example:

* I copied my SSH private key file from my OneDrive. Which requires you to modify those logic.
* I copied my Windows Terminal configuration file from my OneDrive. Which requires you to modify those logic.
